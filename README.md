This archive contains some blueprints to use with an Inovelli Red Dimmer (that allows you to set the LED bar).


It was built out with the following devices:

* Inovelli Red Dimmer
* August SmartLock Pro (zwave)
* MyQ Garage Door opener
* ZwaveJS

In order to set the LEDs i forked scripts from @brianhanifin's [Home-Assistant-Config](https://github.com/brianhanifin/Home-Assistant-Config) repo
