# This blueprint requires the use of two external scripts that must be setup with your configuration. They are available from https://github.com/brianhanifin/Home-Assistant-Config

#
# The "jist" of this blueprint is that it will monitor the status of two items (a lock and a cover) and give you a 4x matrix of color options
# So you can have your inovelli swtich (at a glance) tell you whats up

blueprint:
  name: LED Notifications based on combo of Door and Garage
  description: The idea is to matrix a Door lock status and a garage door (cover) status to give you different light effects. Also it will fire off a moible phone notificaiton. For this blueprint to work, however, you MUST have two separate inovelli scripts installed (inovelli_led.yaml & inovelli_led_set_defaults.yaml).
